December 7, 2025 - 15:10 | Last updated December 7, 2025 - 15:10 Most expectations point to a cut in US interest rates (circulating). Follow Okaz channel on WhatsApp “Okaz” (Jeddah) @okaz_online During the current week, the markets are awaiting the meeting of the US Federal Reserve Board of Directors on the 9th and 10th of December, amid growing expectations for a cut in interest rates. Meanwhile, dovish comments issued by a number of Reserve Board officials have reinforced expectations of a cut in interest rates. The Fed Watch tool, affiliated with The CME Group indicated an 87.2% probability of cutting the interest rate by 25 basis points at the meeting. Expectations were reinforced by the slowdown in the core personal consumption expenditures price index, which excludes food and energy prices (Core PCE), to 2.8% on an annual basis in the month of September, which was below expectations, giving the Federal Reserve more room to cut interest rates in the month of December. The monthly reading recorded 0.2% in September, unchanged from the August reading, to be in line with Expectations. It is noteworthy that the core “PCE” index is considered the preferred measurement tool for Federal Reserve officials to assess inflation in the long term. “The market’s confidence is increasing that the central bank will lower (interest rates) and in response to that, we saw the dollar weaken slightly,” said Bart Melek, head of commodities at TD Securities. “In the wake of the 43-day government shutdown, market traders began digesting the late economic data with the accumulated data slowly shrinking, while also looking to secondary indicators to measure the strength of the economy.” Vice said.

The announcement came during his visit to Perth, a major global mining hub. Badawi outlined the initiative during an Explore in Egypt meeting attended by more than 30 Australian companies and institutions interested in mining opportunities in the country. He said the incentive package accompanies a series of new reforms designed to position Egypt as one of the leading mining destinations in Africa and the Middle East. The reforms include reducing annual fees to make the early stages of exploration more viable, along with tax and customs exemptions for equipment, supplies, and related services. These changes aim to lower upfront costs and ease financial burdens for mining startups and medium-sized enterprises. The minister added that companies will have the flexibility to license multiple types of minerals under a single operating license, reflecting the geological nature of mineral-rich areas and reducing the costs and procedures associated with multiple licenses. He noted that Egypt has begun issuing reconnaissance licenses designed as fast, low-cost permits suitable for startups seeking to assess potential deposits before committi",

Al-Ahmadi will be on Starbucks cups across the Kingdom early next year, as his design, titled “Our Craft,” blends motifs inspired by Saudi craft traditions in a modern form that reflects pride in cultural heritage. Al-Ahmadi said: “I wanted the design to honor the crafts we grew up with, and to present them in a way that is familiar to everyone, reflecting my belief that creativity flourishes when there is passion and support.” Second place went to Abeer Al-Maliki, who reimagined palm frond weaving and basket making in a modern vision that reflects how Saudi traditions carry stories across generations.

Saudi Arabia is implementing reforms aimed at deepening the local stock market and attracting more foreign investors. Experts added that while IPOs are generally viewed as merely an activity to raise money or reduce expenses; However, the Kingdom wants to deepen the market and provide as much liquidity as possible. For this reason, Saudi Arabia is working on creating a pipeline parallel to the regulations to enable traders to trade more easily and to enable foreign investors to participate, ensuring stable growth of companies after the end of the IPO operations. Frequent reports indicate that the Kingdom will organize more than 36 public IPOs during 2026, to ensure an increase in the volume of IPOs, and to attract more brokers and foreign financial funds. This will further deepen Saudi financial markets. Reforms in the Saudi capital market included facilitating foreign ownership and improving transparency. These reforms mean that an emerging market like the Saudi market does not need to wait decades to build credible capital systems.

Driven by the government’s broader push for privatization, the program targets strategic sectors including petroleum, food industries, pharmaceuticals, plastics, banking, and—most notably—renewable energy. Closely tied to Egypt’s commitments under International Monetary Fund (IMF) agreements, this initiative aims to reduce the state’s footprint in the economy, enhance private sector participation, and secure much-needed funding for fiscal stability. By aligning IPO targets with IMF requirements, Egypt seeks to unlock foreign investments and reinforce its credibility in global markets. Clean Energy as a Part of Egypt’s Privatization Drive In 2025, the government committed to privatizing 10 state-owned enterprises (SOEs) across strategic sectors. Ahmed Fawzy Hussein, a PhD holder and an assistant professor of economics, tells Arab finance: “In a world of higher interest rates and tighter external financing, IPOs are a strategic way for Egypt to shift part of the financing burden from sovereign and bank debt towards long-term equity capital.

Qanoonian told Okaz that the ministry’s step enhances transparency and reliability in the transfer of ownership, reduces the complications that appeared in dealing with joint shares, and addresses outstanding issues regarding inheritance, rights of heirs, transfer of ownership, and impeded transactions in agricultural lands. Lawyer Taghreed Haddadi confirmed to Okaz that regulating communal agricultural deeds is a pioneering legal step to enhance property stability and protect the rights of owners. Common agricultural deeds are among the most complex real estate deeds in practice. From a humanitarian perspective, the organization ends the suffering of many families who were unable to divide inheritance, or invest agricultural land, due to the complications associated with communal shares, which enhances justice and preserves rights and family ties. Lawyer Nabil Malhan explained that the joint deed is an ownership document that proves more than one person’s ownership of one land, without precisely specifying each of them’s shares in the land. Each partner in the joint deed has an unspecified share in the land, but he cannot separate his share from the shares of the other partners except by everyone’s agreement, or by the judiciary. He added that some owners may prefer to maintain communal ownership to avoid conflicts and disagreements. The Ministry of Justice addresses the complexities of “common agricultural instruments”",

The registration file refers to communications services that include a personal cell phone, in addition to two-way transmission of text and voice messages and audio materials. A representative for “SpaceX” did not immediately respond to a request for comment. “Starlink” provides broadband Internet service from space via a network of thousands of satellites, and the expansion of this unit has contributed to enhancing the valuation of “SpaceX” to remarkable levels that may reach $800 billion in the latest stock purchase offer, in preparation for a possible initial public offering late next year, according to what was reported by “Bloomberg.” On Friday.

    "content": "Markets: Gold prices stabilized today, Friday, after the rise in US Treasury bond yields erased the impact of the weakness of the dollar, with investors awaiting key inflation data to obtain indications about the path of the US Federal Reserve before next week’s meeting. Gold settled in spot transactions at $4,208.46 per ounce, and is heading for a weekly decline of 0.5%. US gold futures contracts for December delivery fell 0.1% to $4,237.70 per ounce. Bond yields hovered. The 10-year US Treasury is near its highest level in more than two weeks, while the dollar fell and remained near its lowest level in five weeks against a basket of currencies. “The market is waiting for new catalysts that could come in the form of what the Federal Reserve will do,” said Kunal Shah, head of research at Nirmal Bang Commodities. Are Treasury bond yields putting pressure on gold? Shah explained that high Treasury bond yields also play a role in putting pressure on gold prices. Most experts in a Reuters poll that included more than 100 economists expect the Federal Reserve to reduce the key interest rate by 25 basis points at its meeting, which will be held on December 9 and 10. Low interest rates usually support non-yielding assets such as gold. Investors are awaiting the personal consumption expenditures index for September, which is the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure, which is scheduled to be issued at 15:00 GMT. As for other precious metals, silver rose 0.5% to $57.40. per ounce after it recorded a record high level at $58.98 on Wednesday, and is heading for weekly gains. Platinum fell 0.4% to $1,640.25 and is heading for a loss this week.",
