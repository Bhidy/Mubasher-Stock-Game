# How to Install the Updated APK

I have successfully built the updated APK for your Android device.

## 1. Locate the File
The APK file is located at:
```
/Users/home/Documents/Antigravity/android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

## 2. Transfer to Your Phone
You can transfer this file to your Android device using one of these methods:
- **USB Cable**: Connect your phone to your PC and drag the file to your phone's storage.
- **Cloud Storage**: Upload to Google Drive/Dropbox and download it on your phone.
- **Email/Messaging**: Send it to yourself via email or a messaging app (like Telegram or WhatsApp).

## 3. Install
1. On your phone, locate the `app-debug.apk` file using your File Manager.
2. Tap on the file to install.
3. If prompted, allow installation from "Unknown Sources" (since this is a debug build and not from the Play Store).
4. Open the app "Mubasher Stock Game" and enjoy!

## Troubleshooting
- If the app fails to install, try uninstalling the previous version first.
- Ensure "Developer Options" and "USB Debugging" are enabled if you are installing via ADB.
